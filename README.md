# CloudHaven

CloudHaven is a platform for sharing and hosting files online with no time limit.

## Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Access

There are multiple ways to access CloudHaven:

- [CloudHaven](https://cloudhaven.samihindi.com) - On my website
- [CloudHaven](https://cloudhaven.vercel.app) - On Vercel (Stable)

## Motivation

I wanted to create a platform where I could share files with my friends and family without having to worry about the file size or time limit. I also wanted to learn more about Next.js and MongoDB.

## Limitations

- Files are stored in a MongoDB database, so the maximum file size is 16MB.
- There currently exists an Upload Size Limit of 10MB.
